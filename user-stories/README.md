## User Stories Documentation

### Overview

User Stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They follow the template:

> **As a [Role], I want [Goal/Desire], so that [Benefit].**

### Role in Development

User stories are essential for:

1.  **Prioritization:** They are the core units of work in Agile development, allowing features to be easily estimated, prioritized, and placed into sprints.
2.  **User-Centricity:** They ensure that every feature built provides tangible value to the end-user.
3.  **Acceptance Criteria Foundation:** Each story is expanded with clear **Acceptance Criteria** (what defines 'done'), which guides testing and validation.

### Relationship to Use Cases

The user stories in this document directly translate the high-level system interactions identified in the **Use Case Diagram** into actionable, human-readable development tasks.
