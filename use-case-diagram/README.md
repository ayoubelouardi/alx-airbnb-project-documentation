## üìä Use Case Diagram Analysis

This section provides the context and definitions for the **Use Case Diagram** (UML) modeling the primary interactions between external users (Actors) and the core functionalities (Use Cases) of the **Airbnb Clone Backend** system.

---

### üéØ Purpose

The Use Case Diagram visualizes the **functional requirements** from the perspective of the user. Its primary goal is to:
1.  Define the clear **system boundary** (what the backend does).
2.  Identify all external **Actors** who interact with the system.
3.  Illustrate the key **Use Cases** (goals/features) that these actors can perform.

This artifact is critical for stakeholder communication and ensuring the development team builds the correct features that meet user goals.

### üë§ Key Actors

The system interacts with three main external entities, each with distinct permissions and goals:

| Actor | Description | Primary Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guest** | An unauthenticated or registered user looking to browse and book properties. | Search, register, view details, book, and review. |
| **Host** | A registered user who owns and manages property listings on the platform. | Login, create, update, and manage their property inventory. |
| **Payment Gateway** | An external system (e.g., Stripe) responsible for securely processing financial transactions. | Process payment requests and return a success/failure status to the system. |
